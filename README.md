## Description

Consignment-form is a React-based web app that streamlines the process of creating and submitting consignments by providing an intuitive interface with real-time validation, dynamic input fields, and responsive UI components.

## Key Features
- **State Management with React Hooks:** Utilizes React hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect) to manage state changes and side effects, leading to more modular and readable code.
- **React Hook Form:** Simplifies form handling with dynamic validation and better user experience.
- **Toast Notifications:** Integrated with react-toastify for clear and responsive feedback on form submission.
- **Responsive UI:** Built with MUI components as the foundation, offering extensive customization options for flexibility.
